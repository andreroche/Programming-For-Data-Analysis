# explanation - the user inputs an integer. This is b+1 e.g it could be anything.|The +1 ensures it uses that number too! 
# we want to print everything in the range of 1 to the user input value if it's evenly divisible
# it accepts floating point calculations and the input value must be bigger than 0
